vi LJFE OF LUCAN.

to the augural priesthood. Thus far his career had been one
of unbroken success: but it was soon his missortune to offend
the emperorl in some way or other. Nero seems to have shewn
a rival's jealousy'2 of the poetic reputation of Lucan, and the
latter retaliated by making a scoff of the impen'al verses, and
even by composing libellous epigrams on them and their
author. The Pharsalia, on which he had lately been engaged,
and which he had begun with extravagant praise of Nero, seems

emperor: and an accident presently revealed the names of
some of its members10. These when arrested made disclosure
of the names of the others¹1‚ and thus the whole scheme col-
