LIFE OF LUCAN.

illm-cus Annaeus Lucanus was born at Corduba¹, the capital
of the province of Baetica in Spain, in the year 39 A.D. His
father was M. Annaeus Mela2, a Roman Knight and well—known
as the brother of L. Annaeus Seneca the Stoic philosopher:
his mother was C. Acilia3, daughter of Acilius Lucanus an
orator of some note. While yet an infant he was taken by his
father to Rome, where he received the best education that the
capital of the world could afford. It is said that he studied
under the famous grammarian Remmius Palaemon and the Stoic
Cornutus. Among his chief friends were Saleius Bassus the
epic poet and A. Persius Flaccus the satirist‚ who were at this
time his fellow-pupils under the celebrated masters named
above. Our author is said to have displayed his powers at
a very early age, and to have been fully aware of his own pre-
cocity4. Declamations and panegyrical poems seem to have
employed his first efforts: he soon gave recitations, and drew
great applause from his hearers. His rising talent attracted the
notice of Nero5‚ who was in the early years of his reign a
generous patron of literature: the young poet sang the praises
of the young emperor, and was advanced by him to the
quaestorship though not of age for that office, and afterwards
