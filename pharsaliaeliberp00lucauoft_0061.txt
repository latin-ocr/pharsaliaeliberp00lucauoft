NOTES. 41

pererrat]:errat; the word is used by Plin. VIII. ἓ 177=to go
wrong.

434. sert] The Arar (Saone) being a very sluggish stream. Cf.
Caes. B. G. I. 12. Lucan VI. 475, makes the Thessaliam witches
“ reverse the character of the streams, Rhodanumque morantem proe-
cz'pitoz'il Αναν. So the elder Pitt compared the coalition of Newcastle
and Fox to the meeting of these rivers. ‘ At Lyons I was taken to see
the place where the two rivers meet; the one gentle, feeble, languid‚
and though languid yet of no depth; the other a boisterous and
impetuous torrent ; but different as they are they meet at last.'

435. Cebennas] the Cevennes.

436—440. These verses wanting alike in taste and Latinity are ι’

not found in the old MSS. ε hence they are rightly rejected by Grotius.
They are also wanting in the Venetian edition of 1505.

441. convertz] ex Gallia in Italiam transferri bellum. XYeise.

443. Comatae] i. e. Transalpine Gaul, as Plin. H. Λ). IV. ἓ 108,
Gallia omnis Comata uno nomine appellatur.

444. diro] ‘ accursed’zlzumono. Weber cf. Stat. Theb. Χ. 311,

proturba( mensas dirus liquor. Cf. also Lucan, III. 404, structae diris
altaribus arae, omnisque Immanis lustrata cruoribus orbos.

445. Teutates] identified by the Romans with Mercurius; Hesus
with Mars; Taranis with Jupiter. Cf. Mason's Coroctacus, ‘ Yon
central oak whose holiest stem involves the spirit of high Taranis’.

446. For the omission of quam aster the comparative, cf. Verg.
Ecl. III. 105, tres pateat caeli „spatium non amplias ulnas, G. IV. 207,
nequeenim plus septima ducitur aestas, but the omission of the second
ara is remarkable: may not the true reading be Scythica—Diona,
according to the common σχῆμα καθ’ ὅλον καὶ μέροςῖ) Cf. Juv. 111. 74,
sermo promptus et Isaeo torrentior, and Prof. Mayor's note. For Diana,
Scythica or Taurica, cf. Eur. lplz. in Taur.

448. dimittitis]=‘send abroad'. so the MSS. Oud cf. Stat. T heb.
1. 185, augurium seros dsmisit ad usque nepotes, but di and de in com-
position are often confused. Cf. Conington's note on Verg. Aen. VI. 734.

449. secum] The Romans attempted to put down Druidism, cf.
Merivale‚ History of the Romans, cap. 51.

Bardi] XVeber refers to Strabo lv. iv. 4 (197) who makes a distinc-
tion between the Vates and Bardi, παρὰ. πᾶσι δ’ ὡς ἐπίπαν τρία φῦλα
τῶν τιμωμένων διαφερόντως ἐστι, βάρδοι τε καὶ οὑσῖτεις καὶ δρυίδαι·
βάρδοι μὲν ὑμνηταὶ καὶ ποιηταί, οὐάτεις δὲ ἱεροποιοὶ καὶ φυσιολόγοι,
