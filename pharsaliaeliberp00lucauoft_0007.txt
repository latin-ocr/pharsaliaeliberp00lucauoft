THIS little volume, prepared as an experiment, needs
no preface. The Editors have had before them the
editions of Oudendorp WVeber and &Veiscz with several
others for occasional reference. But the notes are in
the main their own, and have been written by them
in concert, Mr Haskins supplying the bulk of the
matter, and prefixing thereto a chronological table
and an abstract of the contents of the book. Mr
Heitland has supplied the life of Lucan and remarks

on the Pharsalia which form the Introduction, and

has also made an Index -to the noteS. It may be

added that brevity has been studied throughout.

CAMBRmoE, May 1875.
