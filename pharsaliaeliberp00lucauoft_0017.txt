THE PHARSALJA. xiii

the taste of his day that gave this turn to the style of Lucan.
He was brought up with the short and pithy sayings of the
Stoics ever in his ears, and no doubt much is to be set down to
their effect, not only on his thoughts, but also on the form of
their expression. Here was an influence to act as a counter-
poise to the rhetoric of the Schools. From this singularly sen-
tentious brevity Lucan is like Horace most apt for quotation,
but with an important difference in the purposes for which he
may be quoted3 there is in his sayings an earnestness and
moral grandeur to which the pleasure-loving satirist never
rises: it may perhaps be more correct to say that Lucan is
himself in this respect a satirist, but of another mould than
Horace. His spirit is more nearly akin to that osJuvenal. But
while noticing the pungent sarcasm which relieves the decla—
matory flow of the Pharsalia, we niu-st not forget the tedious
descriptions1 of places, tribes, military operations, prodigies,
priestly and mystic rites, witchcraft, &c., διο, in minute detai13
matters unimportant in themselves, and serving only to impede
and obscure the action of the poem. But the false taste which
caused these to be inserted is not to be set down wholly as
Lucan’s; it was the taste of the day. This was an age of com-
pilations and common-place books, in a word, the age of
the elder Pliny author of the ‘Natural History'. Instead of
blaming Lucan for putting in these tiresome passages, we
ought perhaps rather to be thankful that there are not more

of thern, that he has not shewn himself more encyclopaedic and
less epigrammatical.
