Stoic—is with them, and they overthrow the party of law and
order: the fall of the Senate is followed by the assassination
of Pompeius, which, had the author lived to continue his poem,
would have been crowned by the suicide of Cato. Meanwhile
· Curio has met with a well—deserved end in Africa, and over
Caesar's head hangs the fated death by the dagger of Brutu51.
Such in the main is the drift of the Pharsalia: but it will be
necessary to make mention of one point further, upon which
opinions may differ. At the beginning of his poem (1. 33—66)
Lucan introduces a studied and fulsome adulation of Nero.
The question is, are any of his later utterances inconsistent
with this? Do they iinply a denunciation of Nero and the
empire, or do they not? Dean Merivale2 maintains that ‘it
‘must be allowed that the tyrant had already revealed much of
‘the evil of his character when the courtier dared to canonize
‘his virtues3 if the stern republicanism of the poem as it ad-
‘vances was an after-thought, it cannot be excused on the
‘common plea, that the vices of tyranny were undiscovered at
‘its cornrnencement. But, after all, this presumed change is a
‘gratuitous imputation. To Nero himself, after the opening in-
‘vocation‚ there is no farther allusion ; and if, as the current of
‘his verse rolls on, his appeals to the spirit of liberty and
‘denunciations of tyranny become more vehement and frequent,
‘we must not suppose that Lucan regarded the principate as a
‘tyranny‚ or, till the last moment of personal pique or indigna-
‘tion, the prince himself as a tyrant.' Against so great an
authority we cannot venture to set a decided opinion; but have
thought it worth while to print here a few passages which it
seems difficult to interpret in accordance with this view.
(a) reflection upon the battle os Pharsalia

maius ab hac acie, quam quod sua saecula ferrent,
vulnus habent populi: plus est quam vit-a salusque
quod perit: in totum mundi prosternimur aevum z
vincitur his gladiis omnis quae serviet aetas.
proxima quid suboles, aut quid meruere nepotes
in regnun nasci? pavidi num gessimus arma,
