LJFE OF LUCAN. vii

lapsed. Among the first taken was Lucan, and to him as to
others false offers of forgiveness were addressed in order to
extort from him the names of accomplices. Here the young
poet failed to act up to his Stoic trainingl: under the sear of
death his constancy gave way, and after holding out for a while
he charged his own mother Acilia with a share in the plot.
But neither this nor a string of confessions2 which followed
could save him: he was soon like the rest condemned to die,
the mode of death being left to his own choice. Accordingly
he nerved himself for his end, went into a hot bath and had
his veins openedss: there he calmly bled to death in the same
way as many other Romans of mark did in those days of
tyranny when suicide was the only refuge from despair. While
the life—blood ran from him he is said to have repeated aloud
some appropriate lines from his own great poem (IX. 811—814):

sanguis erant lacrimae: quaecunque foramina novit
humor, ab his largus manat cruor: ora redundant
et patulae nares: sudor rubet: omnia plenis
membra fluunt venis: totum est pro vulnere corpus.

Thus died Lucan3 and his uncle Seneca and his father Melpst
were involved in the same ruin. His wife, the beautiful and
virtuous Polla Argentaria5 to whom he had been tenderly
attached, survived him many years : and to her were addressed
in rnemory of her husband some short epigrams of Martiah and
the long and over—drawn panegyric of Statius.

Viewing the events of Lucan's life as a whole we may fairly
point to the life of Naevius as in many respects parallel. The
earlier poet sang of the first Punic war, in which he had when
a youth taken part3 the young enthusiast of the decadence
tells of the great civil struggle just past, the effects of which
were still felt and seen: bold in the choice of a main subject,
both handled it with a vigour for which they likewise found
