B. stlanner os llze Poem.

Quintilianl happily remarks: ‘Lucan has in him a fire and
‘vehemence, and sparkles with epigram: in fact, to speak my
‘mind of him, he is rather a model for the orator than the poet!
These few thoughtful words exhaust the merits of Lucan’s style,
and indicate his true place in Roman literature. Helacked the
power of imagination needful for the production of really poetic
narrative3 instead of giving a master—touch to an ordinary
statement, and thereby making it his own for ever, he states
the fact baldly, or gives it an unnatural prominence by means
of tiresome repetition or gross exaggeration. We may well
suspect that even had he been imaginative in a high sense he
would still have been slovenly. For as we find in him none of
the delicate taste in description which we admire in Virgil, so
we are sensible of a monotony in his lines strikingly opposed to
the variety of pauses and free use of elision which aid the rhyth-
mic movement of the Aeneid. There are two pauses of which
Lucan is particularly fond: one is that at the penthemimeral
caesura after a weak caesura in the second foot23 the other at
the hephfflemimeral, after a weak one in the third f00t3. He
‘avoids the use of lines with abnormal caesura, such as Virgil
employs with marked effect3 elisions too and spondaic endings
are rare in his verses. The uniformity produced by such ad-
herence to a few models renders his narrative generally dull, even
in parts where the matter possesses a genuine interest of its own :
but in the speeches which he puts into the mouths of his
characters we feel the monotony less, as we are borne along in
the full swing of his declamatoryvehemence, and enlivened with
a succession of short stinging epigrams (sententiae) which strike
horne and fix themselves in the reader's memory. Our own
literature reminds us that the death of imagination is likely to
be the birth of epigram: but there was something more than
